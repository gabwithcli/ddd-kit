/**
 * ====================================================================================
 * KurrentDB Event Sourcing Repository for the RealEstate Aggregate
 * ====================================================================================
 *
 * What is this file's purpose?
 * ----------------------------
 * This file acts as a persistence adapter, or a "translator," between our rich,
 * behavior-filled domain model (the `RealEstate` aggregate) and the KurrentDB
 * event store.
 *
 * Unlike a traditional CRUD repository that saves the *current state* of an object
 * to a database row, this Event Sourcing (ES) repository saves a *sequence of events*
 * that represent every change ever made to a `RealEstate` asset.
 *
 * Think of it like this:
 * - A CRUD repository takes a snapshot photo.
 * - An ES repository records a video of the entire history.
 *
 * This class implements the generic `AggregateRepository` interface from our `ddd-kit`,
 * meaning the application layer can use it without ever knowing it's talking to an
 * event store. This makes our architecture flexible and persistence-agnostic.

// - We also import the specific error type `StreamNotFoundError` to handle it gracefully.
